# My Phase-4 Project - Mom's Cookbook

## What my project is:
    Are you coming up with new recipe ideas or tweaking old ones?
    Does your mom have the best recipes but no source? 
    Introducing "Mom's Cookbook", an app that allows you to document your recipes.

## How to start it up:
**To start up backend**

    Clone the repository and open it in your terminal. 
    Run:
`$ bundle install` or `$ bundle i`

    Once your dependencies are installed, run:
`$ rails db:migrate`

    Then run:
`$ rails server` or `$ rails s`

    This will start up the Backend server.

    To quit the server, press CTRL + C.


**To start up frontend**

    In a new terminal run: 
`$ npm install --prefix client`

    Then run: 
`$ npm start --prefix client`

    This will start up the Frontend server.
    You will then be taken to the browser to start using the application.

    To quit the server, in the same terminal press CTRL + C.

## How to use it:
    If you already have an account then login using your login information, 
    if not then click on "Signup" to create an account. 
    Once you are signed in you will be taken to the Home page.

    If you have recipes already, click the Category dropdown
    and select which category of recipes you want to see.
    If you have no recipes then the dropdown will be empty.
